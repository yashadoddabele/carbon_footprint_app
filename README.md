# CS207 Project: Carbon App

## By: Tejas Juware, Gavin Eskenazi, Yasha Doddabele, Philip Lee

## App Description

* Our app enables users to track and input carbon footprint data for analyzing their environmental impact over time. 
* Within the app, users can log activities such as transportation, their notes from the day, and other carbon footprint related metrics, tracking their progress toward individually set goals.
* Users will also be able to view their current logs for the day as well as previous logs from the past.
* When clicking on a user's own profile, they are able to view their own achievements such as making their first log, or having a carbon footprint under a certain metric.
* Acting as a social platform, users can add friends, and view their achievements in lowering their carbon footprint.
* The app also features a headline section with news articles relevant to clean energy and the environment. 
* Finally, the app also features a map with mock data for energy usage near Duke University. 

## iOS/API Usage

* NewsAPI: Search, by default, energy and climate related articles.
* MapKit: Shows the Apple Maps of Duke University and its (example) electricity usages in buildings such as Gross Hall.
* Additional calculation for carbon footprint is also used through user-inputted numbers via the logging form.

## Complexities & Considerations

* Pairing MapKit location data with custom energy/environment data
* Ability to view a public view of other users
* Creating authentication so users have their own accounts they can log in / sign up for
